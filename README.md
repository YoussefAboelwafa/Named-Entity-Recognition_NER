# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with HMM & MEMM

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as:
- Oames of persons (PER)
- Organizations (ORG)
- Locations (LOC)
- Miscellaneous (MISC)
- Non-entity (O)

Two models are implemented for NER: 
1. Hidden Markov Model **(HMM)**
2. Maximum Entropy Markov Model **(MEMM)**
